# MediaOS v0.3.0 — SAB‑focused slice (2025‑10‑28)

This release delivers a cohesive SAB‑only feature slice and core UX tightening. It includes file‑backed persistence, Last Grab with Re‑grab, SAB queue controls, Wanted scan/enqueue, Calendar links, and in‑app toasts.

## Highlights

- Item Detail: Last Grab (client, timestamp, status) + Re‑grab
- NZB upload to SAB (multipart), respects SAB category
- Activity: live SAB queue with Pause/Resume/Remove and Open
- SAB history merged into Activity History; optional auto‑verify
- Wanted: scan endpoint + UI; optional enqueue prefers Usenet
- Calendar: events rendered and linked to item detail
- Library: file‑backed persistence with PATCH/DELETE; card/detail edit/delete
- Manual Search filters: protocol, min seeders, min/max size (stubbed)
- In‑app toasts replace alerts; Undo for deletes

## Changes (from CHANGELOG)

### Added

- SAB‑focused slice: Item Detail shows Last Grab with Re‑grab action.
- NZB upload to SAB from Item Detail (multipart); respects SAB category from settings.
- Live SAB queue in Activity with Pause/Resume/Remove and Open‑in‑client.
- SAB history merged into Activity History; optional auto‑verify trigger on completion (poller).
- Wanted: server scan endpoint and UI Scan button; optional enqueue prefers Usenet.
- Calendar: generated events are rendered and clickable to item detail.
- Library persistence (file‑backed) with PATCH/DELETE; UI edit/delete on cards and item detail.
- Manual Search filters: protocol, min seeders, min/max size (stubbed results for now).
- In‑app toasts (replace alerts) with Undo for deletes.

### Changed

- Unified settings for SAB (timeout, category) used by grabs and uploads.
- Verify panel auto‑refreshes briefly to surface background results after load.

### Docs

- Added docs/RELEASE.md (release process), docs/SAB_SETUP.md (SAB‑only setup), docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md (backlog).

### Notes

- Background pollers are optional; enable SAB auto‑verify via `ENABLE_SAB_VERIFY_ON_COMPLETE=true`.

## Setup

- Follow `docs/SAB_SETUP.md` for configuring SAB and running a quick smoke.
- File‑backed state lives under `config/` (see `config/README.md`).

## Verification

- Lint/type‑check pass with warnings only; pre‑push hooks enforce lint + type‑check.
- For SAB smoke tests, set `E2E_SAB=1` and `E2E_NZB_PATH` then run `npm run test:e2e`.
